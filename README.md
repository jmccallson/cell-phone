"# cell-phone-usage"

I have decided to go with spring boot this could then either be used with a web application
or backend. I have decided to convert the data from the CSV files to data objects. I usually would write unit test and acceptance test, but as to keep time short I have not added them in. I have tried to inject as much as possible to make coding and reading of the code simple. If I was given more time I would have converted some of it to streams to see if it would have sped things up. I have chosen maven to keep track of my dependencies.

if you run the main under Application and then type http://localhost:8080/pdfreport in your
browser your report should popup and allow you to print to your printer.
